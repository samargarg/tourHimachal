            <p>Manali, at the northern end of the Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, is a hill station at a height of 2,050 m (6,398 ft) in the Himalayas. Situated on the Beas River (Vyaas in Hindi) and near its source, it is a popular tourist spot for Indians in summer and a magical, snow-covered place in winter. A staging point for a number of treks (Beas Kund, Chandrakhani Pass) and sports such as white-water rafting, Manali is also on the road to Ladakh via the valley of Lahaul and Spiti and Rohtang Pass, which is the main attraction near Manali.</p>

            <h3>PLANE</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-airport-96.png" alt="">
            <p>The nearest airport is Bhuntar (Kullu) Airport (KUU IATA); Tel: 01902-265037, 265603), 50 km from Manali, 10 km from Kullu, about one hour away. Air-India has a morning flight from Delhi operated by Alliance Air. Delhi is the nearest international airport, 560 km away from Manali. That airport is well connected to major cities in India as well as cities abroad.</p>

            <h3>BUS</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-bus-100.png" alt="">
            <p>Manali is about 570 km from Delhi, the capital of India, and there are buses connecting the town with Delhi, Shimla, Dharamsala and Leh. For service from Delhi to Manali, tickets and reservations can be made at the Inter State Bus Terminus as well as at the Himachal Tourism office on Safdar Hashmi Marg near Mandi House in New Delhi. The approximate travel time from Delhi to Manali is 14 hours; from Ambala to Manali is 10 hours; and from Kulu to Manali is 1½ to 3 hours. Volvo buses—which depart at around 17:00 and reach at 09:00-10:00 next day—are available from Delhi and is the best option in terms of comfort and value for money to reach Manali but you need to book these in advance. Hotels like kapoor resort book your volvo with wifi connection and personal led screen along with their hotel package.</p>
            
            <h3>TRAIN</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-subway-100.png" alt="">
            <p>The nearest Broad Gauge Rail Head is Chandigarh (310 km). Ambala Cantonment en route Chandigarh is on the Delhi - Amritsar and Delhi - Jammu main lines and is well-served by rail, but you will need to travel to Ambala to get a bus for the 10 hour ride to Manali. Jogindernagar and Kalka are other, less preferable, rail heads for Manali. The nearest Broad gauge station is Kiratpur Sahib in Punjab near the city of Nangal. It lies in Ropar district of Punjab. The station lies on the Ambala Cantt - Una route of Indian Railways. From here you can easily get buses for Manali.</p>
            
            <h3>TAXI</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-car-100.png" alt="">
            <p>If hiring a private taxi, ensure that the driver has experience driving in hilly regions and does not have the habit of drinking alcohol. Also make sure the driver has done the trip at least once before and knows all roads. Also make sure that the driver is used to drive for long hours. Many operators turn off air-conditioning during the majority of the hill journey, or demand to be paid extra if asked to. Best to confirm this prior to booking. If you are going to Manali through Chandigarh-Ropar-Kiratpur-Bilaspur-Mandi-Kullu highway, then your driver would need to drive on hilly roads for at least 6 hours. The expected price is somewhere around ₹3000 to ₹4000/day for an Indica hatchback or a bigger Innova car from Delhi.</p>
