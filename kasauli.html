            <p>Kasauli is a small town in the state of Himachal Pradesh located at an altitude of 1,927 m. The town is 77 km from Shimla and 70 km from Chandigarh. Legend says that it came into existence after Lord Hanuman placed his feet here in order to advance on to the Sanjeevani hill. The place where the lord actually kept his feet is believed to be at a hillock which is 300 m high.</p>
            <p>Kasauli is a hill station that was developed by the British Empire during its peak period in India. Despite its beauty, it has yet to find itself prominently on the tourist's map. In fact, it is very good for all those who yearn to spend some time alone with their family or with themselves.</p>  
            <p>If you happen to visit the town during the off-season (November to February), it is quite likely that you will not come across any person for a long while on your walk. For those who are looking for fun and adventure, Kasauli will be a disappointment as there is hardly anything to do. There are some small attractions within and around the town that will keep you somewhat busy.</p>
