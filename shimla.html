            <p>Shimla has a population of around 172,000 (which may increase by another 100,000 with the seasonal influx of voyagers). Most residents are from the Pahadi community (the natives of Himachal Pradesh), but there is also a sizable minority from Punjab and Sindh, who moved to Shimla during the partition. As a result, the languages spoken in Shimla include Hindi, Punjabi, Pahadi and English which serves as a lingua franca.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Climate</h2>
        <div class="subdata">
            <p>Shimla's cool climate is the precise reason why it is such a popular summer retreat. Located at an altitude of approximately 2200 m above sea level, the region has a hilly terrain and is covered by dense evergreen forests. A few visitors choose to visit Shimla during spring or autumn, when the place is less crowded and the views are too spectacular for words.</p>

            <h3>PLANE</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-airport-96.png" alt="">
            <p>Shimla Airport (SLV IATA) (Jubbarhatti, 22 km away) - Due to the difficulties of the mountainous terrain, poor condition of road surfaces and the increasing traffic congestion the journey by car can takes hours. The airport has severe limitations imposed by its elevation at 1,546 metres above sea level and by the shortness of its single runway (1,230 m) which ends in precipice at either end, and it can accommodate only turboprop aircraft.</p>
            <p>After landing at the airport, take a pre-paid taxi to minimize hassle. Chandigarh is a good four-hour drive away, so stop for a bite on the Kalka-Shimla highway.</p>
            <p>Jets can all land at the larger Chandigarh (IXC IATA) airport. The Chandigarh Airport, 120 km from Shimla along far better roads and at an elevation of only 308 metres above sea level, offers far better flight options. Major airlines including Air India and Air Deccan operate flights to Delhi, Jammu, and Mumbai. Most of the flights to Mumbai require a stopover in Delhi. Confirm the flights as bad weather often delays flights during the winter fog.</p>

            
            <h3>TRAIN</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-subway-100.png" alt="">
            <p>The nearest broad gauge station is at Kalka, a four-to-seven hour journey from Delhi. After that, take the mountain train from Kalka to Shimla. This railway track was granted the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. The view is stunning, with the line passing through an amazing 102 tunnels. The fastest way to get to Kalka is to catch the Shatabdi Express, which departs early morning from the New Delhi Railway Station, arriving at Kalka four hours later. A detailed list of trains between Delhi, Kalka and Shimla is available here.</p>

            <p>You can also choose to get off at Chandigarh (en route to Kalka), and catch a taxi from there.</p>
                
            <p>While the Shivalik Deluxe Express can be reserved 120 days in advance like most Indian trains, most of the other mountain trains can only be reserved 30 days before journey date. Passengers on the Shivalik Deluxe Express are served meals on the train: breakfast on the way to Shimla and dinner on the way down.</p>
            
            <h3>TAXI</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-car-100.png" alt="">
            <p>Shimla is nicely connected by road to different major cities. Government and private buses are available from Chandigarh to Shimla within a gap of half an hour. Deluxe and semi-deluxe buses are also frequently available from different places. Along the highway there are more than thirty restaurants, dhabas and fast food places.</p>
