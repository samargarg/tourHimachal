            <p>The Tibetan Buddhist roots of Dharamsala stretch back to the 8th century, although most of the 
                local population long since reverted to (and remains) Hindu. "Dharamsala" literally means an 
                "inn attached to a temple", and it was so until the district headquarters in Kangra became too 
                crowded and the British moved 2 of their regiments in the late 1840s to what is now Dharamsala. 
                Over the years, this grew to be district headquarters of Kangra, and the location is now known 
                as the Police Lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dharamsala was mooted to be the summer capital of India. But this was not to be, as much of the 
                town was destroyed in the 7.8 magnitude earthquake of 4 April 1905. The disaster killed over 
                10,000 people in this sparsely populated area.
            </p>  
            <p> 
                After falling into obscurity in the early days of Indian independence, Dharamsala regained some 
                social standing in 1959 with the arrival of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in Exile. 
                It is a very popular hang-out for foreigners and students of Buddhism. Indeed, it is now perhaps 
                a little too popular and many would say the town, and especially McLeod Ganj, is little more than 
                a backpacker ghetto. Don't come here expecting calm and tranquillity.
            </p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Climate</h2>
        <div class="subdata">
            <p>
                Lower Dharamsala is at an altitude of 1,400 m, while McLeod Ganj is at around 1,750 m, making 
                them considerably cooler than the plains below. Temperatures in January can dip below freezing, 
                while June can go up to 38°C. The monsoon from July to September is very wet. Even in March, 
                when the Dalai Lama holds his teachings and the weather down in Delhi is balmy, you will still 
                need a heavy winter coat. These can be purchased at reasonable prices in the town.

            <h3>PLANE</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-airport-96.png" alt="">
            <p>Kangra Airport is at Gaggal near Kangra, a distance of 15 km from McLeodganj by road on MDR44 and NH20. Air India, Alliance Air and SpiceJet operate daily flights to Dharmasala from Delhi.</p>

            <h3>BUS</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-bus-100.png" alt="">
            <p>Most people arrive in Dharamsala by bus. It has good connections with other parts of North India, although the journeys are often slow due to the narrow winding roads in the hills. The main bus terminal is in Lower Dharamsala, but some public HRTC buses to Delhi and Pathankot go all the way to the main square of McLeod Ganj, where you can also book advance tickets for the return trip. Privately operated buses travel from Manali, Dehradun and Delhi. Overnight buses travel from Delhi with many leaving from the Tibetan colony of Majnu ka Tilla. These services take upwards of 13 hr and cost from ₹450 for a basic bus to ₹1,000 for a plusher Volvo. Tickets for Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC, a state government body) can be booked online at http://hrtc.gov.in/HRTCTickets/</p>
            
            <h3>TRAIN</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-subway-100.png" alt="">
            <p>The nearest broad gauge railhead is at Pathankot and the neighboring small station of Chakki Bank, a comfortable overnight journey from Delhi. Train buffs can continue on the very slow and rickety but pretty Kangra Valley Railway to Kangra, a journey that easily takes up to 6 hours and still leaves you 18 km from McLeod Ganj. Many choose to continue by bus or taxi instead. If you do choose to go to Kangra then from the train station then you must walk and autorickshaw to the bus stop where buses are available to take you to Dharamsala.</p>
            
            <h3>TAXI</h3>
            <img src="icons/icons8-car-100.png" alt="">
            <p>A taxi from Pathankot to McLeod Ganj, 88 km and takes about 3 hours, and the official fare from Pathankot is ₹2,200 (one way). This is May 2019 rate for a small car such as an Alto/Indica. Taxis from Delhi are often available leaving from Majnu Ki Tila Tibetan settlement in North Delhi on the ring road. Many people take a taxi to Delhi which takes about 10 hours and pay the return fare simply because they don't want to deal with the hassle and pain of taking a bus. These taxis need to return to Dharamshala, and many times will sell seats in their car for the same price as a bus ticket. To find these taxis, go to the Majnu Ki Tila Tibetan Settlement Bus Stand and look for taxis which have Himachal Pradesh licence plates. You can negotiate with a driver. Often the taxis will leave in the evening and you will arrive in Dharamshala early the next morning.</p>
